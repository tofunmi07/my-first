After a particle accelerator causes a freak storm, CSI Investigator Barry Allen is struck by lightning and falls into a
coma. Months later he awakens with the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central City like
an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound powers, Barry is shocked to discover he is not the
only "meta-human" who was created in the wake of the accelerator explosion -- and not everyone is using their new powers
for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates his life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close
friends and associates know that Barry is literally the fastest man alive, but it won't be long before the world learns
what Barry Allen has become...The Flash. Barry Allen is a forensic scientist and crime scene investigator at The Central City Police Department with a reasonable
happy life, despite the childhood trauma of a man in a red and yellow bizarre killing his mother and framing his father
for it. All that changes when a massive particle accelerator created by visionary physicist Dr. Harrison Wells and his
team at S.T.A.R Labs causes a malfunction creating a freak storm, killing many people and Barry being struck by
lightning in his lab. He wakes up after a coma nine months later. He and his new friends at S.T.A.R Labs discover that
he has superhuman speed and can run on both land and water. He can move, think and react at light speeds. He can also
vibrate so fast that he can pass through walls, travel through time and lend or borrow speed. He heals more quickly than
an average human.
