<h1>GOTHAM - THE CITY OF CRIME</h1>
<p>In crime ridden Gotham City, Thomas and Martha Wayne are murdered before young Bruce Wayne's eyes. Although Gotham City
Police Department detectives, James Gordon, and his cynical partner, Harvey Bullock, seem to solace's the case quickly,
things are not so simple. Inspired by Bruce's traumatized desire for justice, Gordon vows to find it amid Gotham's
corruption. Thus begins Gordon's lonely quest that would set him against his own comrades and the underworld with their
own deadly rivalries and mysteries. In the coming wars, innocence will be lost and compromises will be made as some
criminals will fall as casualties while others will rise as super villains. All the while, young Bruce observes this war
with a growing obsession that would one day drive him to seek his own justice against the evil of Gotham as The Batman.</p>
<p>Detective James Gordon is a new recruit assigned to investigate the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne. The case
acquaints him with the slain couple's son and future crusader, Bruce.</p>

<h1> THE STORY OF JAMES GORDON </h1>
<p>Years before the first appearance of the Batman, GCPD lieutenant Jim Gordon takes up an impossible task: cleaning up the
most morally bankrupt city on earth. As Gordon fights against corruption, criminals and lunatics, Bruce Wayne prepares
for his journey to become the most feared vigilante this city has ever seen.</p>
<p>The good. The evil. The beginning. Everyone knows the name Commissioner Gordon. He is one of the crime world's greatest
foes, a man whose reputation is synonymous with law and order. But what is known of Gordon's story and his rise from
rookie detective to Police Commissioner? What did it take to navigate the multiple layers of corruption that secretly
ruled Gotham City, the spawning ground of the world's most iconic villains? And what circumstances created them - the
larger-than-life personas who would become Catwoman, The Penguin, The Riddler, Two-Face and The Joker?</p>
